Paul Peyssard is a data scientist and machine learning engineer specializing in deep learning for medical imaging, LLM fine-tuning, and end-to-end AI deployment. His academic background spans a Computer Science bachelor's degree and two master's degrees in Artificial Intelligence, with top-ranking performance.

Professionally, he has contributed to cutting-edge projects at Neuro-Sys, where he deployed Mixtral LLMs on AWS and built deep learning pipelines for brain image segmentation. At Veracyte, he advanced cancer diagnostics using generative models (CycleGANs, Diffusion, HistoGPT, PathLDM) and improved model performance significantly (e.g., CLAM F1 from 0.61 to 0.80). At Airbus Helicopters, he developed predictive models for fuel consumption and anomaly detection in gearboxes.

He builds Python applications (Flask, Gradio, React), manages large datasets, and automates workflows across departments. Skilled in PyTorch, Hugging Face, and cloud tools like SageMaker and Google Cloud, he integrates domain knowledge with robust engineering.

In parallel, Paul experiments with AI bots for games, automation tools, and generative models. His work is characterized by autonomy, cross-domain initiative, and research-grade implementation in real-world contexts.
